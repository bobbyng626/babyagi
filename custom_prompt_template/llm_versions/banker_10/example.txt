Act as: You are a horse racing analyst in Hong Kong Jockey Club. Each race consist of various number of horses, ranged from 6 horses to 14 horse. Each horse is managed by a Trainer and ridden by a Jockey. Your job is to analyse a horse race, by summarizing the relationship of the Jockey and Trainer of different participating J-T (J-T means jockey-trainer combination). 

Limitation: Based on all the information in this context provide a ranking. Do not search external data and concepts. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

The following prompt includes these sections:
1. "CONCEPTS" is the key idea of this horse racing field, it describe all neccessary concepts to decide the chance of the combination to get into first ranking in the horse race.
2. "CURRENT RACE" is the user input that includes all current data and insight.
3. "PAST RACE" is the list of races that describe the winning and losing jockey of each race, and the amount of money the winner wins, use this to judge the current race landscape and distribution of jockey by relationship.
3. "INSTRUCTION" is the user requirement for the race, it includes some new reminder from user and the final goal of the query, based on the information provided only in this query and CURRENT RACE.

Base on what you will learn in "CONCEPTS" about customized values and general knowledge, to analyze the "CURRENT RACE", and give out result as stated in "INSTRUCTION".

CONCEPTS:

1. Ranking is the final ranking and position of a race for all horses, "1st" rank is the best ranking followed by "2nd","3rd", and so on. For example if a race with 4 horses, the ranking will be like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th. For this 4 horses ranking, "1st" means the winner or the first place, while "4th" means the horse with least winning chance and has worst ranking.

2. "Win odds" is an index to find the winner of the race. A horse race is actually a large competition between the participating horses, some horses are strong and have good past result, while some horses are not performing very well or not being trusted by bettors to win the current race. In the current race, you will have the competitive landscape of these horses, their competitive power is represented by Win Odds value. "Win odds" include 4 values 1/2/3/4, which determine the bettor's confidence level to trust the horse to win the race. Win odds is a very important factor to reflect the actual winning chance of a horse, this has more impact to the final ranking. Lower the win odds value means a lot of bettors believe it can win the race, Lower win odds, higher confidence. Win odds 1 means very high confidence, 2 is relatively high confidence, while 3 is less confidence and 4 show least confidence.
You have the data and sense to determine the winner with win odds, it is normal that you choose the winner with lowest win odds, but only using win odds is not enough to determine the winner. The reason is lower win odds means the profit return is also small, once the winner is not the lowest win odds horse, we will lose all the money and it actually happens a lot. So only by win odds cannot determine the best solution to choose the winner. So, avoid directly determine the winner by win odds, consider other factors as well.

3. "Jockey Relationship" is a bit complicated, it described the past races winning and losing pattern among the participating jockey. As describe in "Win Odds", lower win odds means more investment and more confident for the horse to win, but still there are many horse with lowest win odds, but still lose the race. We consider these favorable jockey and horse that lose the race as a relationship exchange with other jockey. For example, a jockey ABC with low win odds lose the race intentionally to another jockey DEF, so DEF can win the race with higher win odds, which means a higher return, and so after a few race, jokcey DEF might have lower win odds and he can now lose the race intentionally for paying back to ABC. This is some assumption from us and we want you to analyze past few races and see if it is applicable to current race. You will receive the past race result exchange in the "PAST RACES" section, it started with the race date and race number, followed by the losing jockey and winning jockey on that particular race, for example "Race Date: 2023-09-10, Race 1:  HEL and YML LOSE to BH for 6M" means on 2023-09-10 race number 1, jockey HEL and jockey YML have low win odds, but they loses the race, the winner of that race is BH, BH wins 6M (6 milliions) dollors from HEL and YML. You should take this relationship in consideration for current race, to judge whether the current race jockey distribution might happens some intentionally losing case. Remember, we only consider those jockey with lowest win odds (highest confidence from investor) that loses in this section.

4. "Investment Contrast" means the confidence difference of the horses, by evaluating their invested money from bettor. Some horses does not deserve the high confidence from the bettor, it makes their win odds become very low, we called it overbought, that means the horse takes more confidence and investment than they deserves. We use the investment contrast to compare the investmenr difference of four horses. it includes THREE comparison, contrast of Horse 1 and Horse 2, contrast of Horse 2 and Horse 3, contrast of Horse 3 and Horse 4. each comparison will be represented by "VERY HIGH", "HIGH", "LOW" and "VERY LOW" contrast. VERY HIGH contrast means the former horse has a lot more confidence than the later horse, it also indicates the horse has been overbought and carrying confidence that does not suitable for this horse. VERY LOW contrast means the former horse has slightly or very little contrast only to the later horse only. Use these FOUR contrast ratio to determine the competitive landscape of the horse race. Rank the 4 horses after you evaluate the win odds and the investment contrast.

5. For each H-J-T, another aspect to choose the winner is the "Fail Rate", it indicates a rate for the jockey-trainer combination to win a race under the existing investment contrast situation. If the fail rate is True, it means the J-T (Jocket-Trainer) is too weak and the ranking of the combination will not be good, it has verry low chance to win the horse and you should eliminate the horse or put its ranking backward. Most of the case, if the fail rate is true, the horse is NOT POSSIBLE to win, and you should put it at least after 3rd place. If the fail rate is false, it means the J-T (Jocket-Trainer) is just acting normal.
The following concetps, 3, 4 is the concepts to compare the horse expected behavior and the actual win odds, we use this to evalaute if there are abnormal investment and arrangement on the horse race, to decide if the horse is bought to win or its an hallucination if there are investment.

6. For each H-J-T, we computed an expected invesment for them, indicating the public expectation on the horse to win the race. Then we compare the actual win odds of the horse and the expected investment, to see if the horse now is fulilling a suitable win odds range. There are two values for the "Expected Investement Change", More or Less, More means the horse is getting more investment than expected, Less means the horse is getting less investment from bettors than our expectation.

7. To evlaute the investment intend of the horse, we want to evaluate the win odds of the horse is reasonable or not, so to decide whether we can trust the win odds and use it to judge the winning chance directly, we have 2 aspects, OB (overbought) and Reasonable CI (Confidence interval).
OB means the phenomenon of Overbought, to decide whether the horse is being overly invested, that the investment exceed the capability and strength of the horse. It include 2 values, True or False, where True means the horse is heavily invested and baring way too much confidence and might be failed to win as the win odds is not reflecting the actual strength of the horse. False means the horse is having suitable investment and the win odds reflects a reasonable strength of the horse.
Reasonable CI is another value to judge the confidence of the jockey and trainer is reasonable or not. We have a Confidence Interval (CI) for each combination, but some jockey and trainer is performing better in certain CI range, we describe the combination is reasonable if their CI lies in their comfortable CI range. Reasonable CI True means the horse has reasonable CI and it can perform their best to winner, it shows the intend of the combinaton. False means the horse does not has reasonable CI and might show the win odds of the horse is not trustable
Reasonable QW is another value similar to Reasonable CI, but the value is obtained by the contrast of of winning chance and the chance to get into Top 2 ranking (1st, 2nd). Many people bet on the win pool and the quniella pool, which means the pool to bet the horse can get into Top 2 ranking. We obtained the contrast and constructed another reasonable value for the horse. Reasonable QW True means the horse has reasonable can perform their best to compete and win, it shows the intend of the combinaton. False means the horse does not has reasonable QW and might show the win odds of the horse is not trustable. 

8. Final aspect to judge the winning chance of the horse is the "Investment Difference Rate", under the Expected Investment Change, no matter the horse has more investment or less investment than the expected win odds, there will be a probabilty chance to evaluate the winning chance of the horse. We indicates this winning chance by the "Investment Difference Rate". It contains 4 values, 1/2/3/4, smaller the value means lower winning chance for the combination, higher the value means higher winning chance. Investment Difference Rate 4 means the combination has good past winning chance under the exuisting expected Investment Change, while 1 means the combination has very poor past performance and basically cannot win the race, put the combination in worse rank.
