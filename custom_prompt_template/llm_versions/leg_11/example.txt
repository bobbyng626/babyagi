CONCEPTS:
0. Ranking is the final ranking of a race with the horse, 1st rank is the best ranking followed by 2nd and 3rd, and so on. One important concept in ranking is the "Top 4" ranking, Top 4 means the first four place in the ranking, for example if a race with 7 horses, the ranking will be like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, Top 4 means the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th rank. For this 7 horses ranking, 1st means the winner and the first place, and 7th means the horse with least winning chance and has worst ranking. If a horse is with win odds 1, it will have highest chance to rank into Top 4 ranking.

1. "Win odds" include 4 values 1/2/3/4, which determine the bettor's confidence level to trust the horse to win the race. Win odds is a very important factor to reflect the actual winning chance of a horse, this has more impact to the final ranking. Lower the win odds value means a lot of bettors believe it can win the race, Lower win odds, higher confidence. Win odds 1 means very high confidence, 2 is relatively high confidence, while 3 and 4 show less confidence. So, for win odds 1 horse, it has a lot of confidence from public so it must be ranked in [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th] place no matter how the other data of this horse performs.

2. "Jockey and trainer" information, indicates the strength and performance of jockey and trainer. It includes 2 indexes, Tier and Win Rate.

Jockey and Trainer Tier, includes 3 values 1/2/3, indicates the general strength of the jockey or trainer, tier 3 is the most powerful jockey or trainer and have high confidence, tier 2 is less powerful but still competitive, tier 1 jockey usually has less confidence in Top 4 rank or winner place.

Jockey and Trainer Rate, includes 4 values 1/2/3/4 is interpreted by past race ranking and indicates the jockey or trainer's chance to get into Top 4, separatelyfor jockey and trainer. The jockey or trainer may be favorable to get into top 4 in some specific win odds value. The rate is 4 means the jockey or trainer has a higher chance to get into Top 4, 3 means the jockey or trainer has a medium chance, 2 means the jockey or trainer has a lower chance, and 1 means basically no chance for it.

3. "Investment velocity" indicates the instant confidence change of the horse by the betting amount before the race start. It includes 1 index, Overbought.

Overbought (OB) is the phenomenon of bettors having extreme confidence in the Jockey and Trainer, and betting over the normal level of investment on the jockey trainer for the race. However, some jockey and trainer is not capable to success in an Overbought situation. OB includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, OB 0 means the combination does not have the phenomenon of Overbought, meaning bettors normally invest them. OB 1 means the combination has been overbought and has a low chance to get into top 4. Increasing OB means the top 4 chance is also growing, OB 4 means the combination has overbought and has a very high chance to get into Top 4. 

4. "Past Race Performance" is the performance of the horse-jockey-trainer from past races ranking. It separately describes the general past performance of the horse, training and jockey-trainer, so we conducted three indexes to evaluate the past performance of these horses, training and the jockey-trainer combination. These three indexes gives only reference to judge the past race performance of the Jockey-trainer, Horse and Training, their performance might changed due to more training recently, take this as past reference and adjust the ranking rather than directly decide their ranking.

JT Performance Index, which includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, indicates the past performance result of the jockey and trainer. JT Performance Index 0 shows a very low occurrence of Top 4 races for this combination while increasing the JT Performance Index means better performance from the past. JT Performance Index 4 means a very high top 4 rank occurrence from past races. Combining the chance for both jockey and trainer by their past performance index and comparing with other jockey and trainer to get the past performance of the combination.

The Horse Performance Index also includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, indicating the past performance result of the horses. Horse Performance 0 means the horse has fewer Top 4 rank occurance race before, and 4 means a high number of Top 4 occurrence.

The Training Performance Index also includes 5 values 0/1/2/3/4, indicating the past training performance result of the horses. Training Performance 0 means the horse has fewer Top 4 rank occurance race before, and 4 means a high number of Top 4 occurance.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
---
[Step 1]: Consider the Jockey and Trainer for riding the horse, evaluate if this combination is good for getting into Top 4 the race.
---
[Step 2]: Consider the Investment Velocity to see the Bettor's immediate response to the confidence of the horse and some extreme cases of combination
---
[Step 3]: Get the Past Performance of the horse-jockey-trainer, consider as a past race reference for jockey-trainer, horse strength and training performance separately.
---
[Step 4]: Analyze Win Odds for the winning chance of the horse, and compare difference horses win odds to see the current race-winning chance of each horse.
[Reminder] CHAIN OF THOUGHT is just the steps to solve the ranking problem, no factor alone is extremely important to judge the ranking, try to balance each factor and compare the overall horses performance and do the ranking.
